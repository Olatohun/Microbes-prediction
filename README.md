### Project Motivation

The aim of this project is to analyse  microbes data and Build a Machine Learning model that predicts which class each microbe belongs to.



### Installation

Python V-3.

Python Libraries:

Scikit Learn. 

Pandas. 

Numpy.

Seaborn

Matplotlib.



### Data

The data was gotten from the Data sprint 71 hackathon on DPhi titled Microbes Classification. Full description of the data is available on [DPhi](https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-71-microbes-classification/207/overview/evaluation).


### Implementation

Three classification models were run on the data, including Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. The data was splitted into X and y before scaling. The models were run on both the scaled and unscaled data with a ratio of 70:30 and performance was reviewed using the accuracy score metric.


### Results
The output of the prediction result is in ‘microorganisms_predictions.csv’ above and in the code as well.
